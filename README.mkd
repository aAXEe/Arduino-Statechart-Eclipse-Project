YAKINDU Statechart Tools (SCT) provides an integrated modeling environment for the specification and development of reactive, event-driven systems based on the concept of statecharts. 

The example TrafficLight is one of examples shipped with SCT. It was ported to use the Aduino core library for pin, time and uart handling. It is now a simple base to start own projects.

The installation of the ArduinoCore library is described here: https://github.com/allgood38/Arduino-Blink-Eclipse-Project

An introduction to Yakindu Statecharts is here: http://www.statecharts.org/index.html

Another implementation of this example also for the Arduino hardware but without using the core library: http://scholtyssek.blogspot.de/2013/10/yakindu-statechart-tools-arduino.html
